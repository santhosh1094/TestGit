I have fixed the program type sorting issue in the invoice screen. However, during testing, I observed a global issue across all screens. Sorting only works once for each column. For example, clicking on a column sorts it in ascending/descending order the first time. Clicking the same column a second time doesn't trigger the expected reverse sorting.
